    <p>The Solar Panel Sun Tracker is based on a design by <a href="mdpub.com/suntracker/index.html">Mike Davis</a>. His design is for 34.6 degrees north but I am redimensioning for 40 degrees North. I also demnsioned it so it could be ajusted in elevation from x degrees yo y degrees. It is also dimensioned to rotate from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. The result is a rather large dimension for the base and height of the mount</p>
