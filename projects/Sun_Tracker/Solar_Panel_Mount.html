    <p class="tab indented"><font face = "Courier" size="4">The Solar Panel Sun Tracker is based on a design by <a href="http://mdpub.com/suntracker/index.html">Mike Davis</a>. His design is for 34.6 degrees north but I am redimensioning for 40 degrees North. I also demnsioned it so it could be ajusted in elevation from x degrees to y degrees. It is also dimensioned to rotate from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. The result is a rather large dimension for the base and height of the mount. The thing I found attactive about this design is that it uses a Uniden U-100 rotor which I am familiar with. It is the same rotor that I am using for the satelite antenna rotors. Mike used an MBED controller but I'm going to use an Arduino Uno. He is also using solar cells to detect which direction the panel needs to rotate. Instead I am going to use photoresistors for sensors. He is using roller lever arm switches for the limit switches. I am going to use magnetic reed switches that are used as door sensors. These sensors are encased and I believe would handle the outside envirnoment better.</p>
