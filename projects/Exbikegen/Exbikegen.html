     <p class="indented"><font face = "Courier" size="4">My neighboor threw out this exercise bike so I rescued it and made an exercise bike/solar panel generator out of it. In retrospect, I wish I had gotten a gel cell battery instead of the lead acid battery because a gel cell can be deep cycled and would be more apporpiate for this application. I intend to use this generator for ham radio field days and for setting up in an outdoor space in ham radio flea markets or when I go camping. The solar panel is the one I intend to use on the solar panel tracker project. Right now, it's just leaning up against the back of a chair. Other people on the web have built bicycle generators using automobile alternators (an easy search on google) but they require building a frame. </p>

	<p class="indented"><font face = "Courier" size="4">Here is a picture of the original exercibike before I took the inertial wheel and the original pedals off of it. It might of been desireable to leave the inertial wheel on inorder to smooth out an uneven peddling. Howver, with the wheel and a lead acid battery, the whole thing would have been very heavy.</p>
