Converted the scanned pdf file from pdf to jpg and uploaded it to the sun tracker project.  Added a bunch of YouTube links to various projects. Spent most of the day packing stuff in the house to get it out of the master bedroom so that Painter Bob cna pull up the carpet so that the refinishers can give me an estimate for redoing the hardwood floors of the house.
