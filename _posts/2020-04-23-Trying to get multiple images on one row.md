Got the quote from the floor guy. The asbestos guy came today to look at the ducts in the basement. He seemed to think it will be no big deal the contain the asbestos.

I'm trying to format some of the pisctures in the Wine Bottles project so that some of the pictures are on the same row but it likes squeezing a baloon. As soon as I change one thing, something else gets messed up. I'm spending too much time on this and getting frustrated so for the time being, I'm going to move on to something else.

Bob said he was coming around noon today to set up in the garage but he still hasn't shown up.

I'm praticing Spanish by watching CNN Espanhol. Last night, Bob and Cindi skyped me.
