   I'm going to see how markup works in posting to the blog. If it works, I'll be posting more regularly. On Thursday, I added a lot more content to the website. Yesterday, I made a first cut at the design of the solar panel tracker. It is based on Mike Davis' solar panel design. Details will be in the Solar Tracker projects folder.
