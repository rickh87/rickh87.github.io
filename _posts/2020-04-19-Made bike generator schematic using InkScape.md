Finally got the layout of the website figured out. Now I can concentrate on content. The first thing I am going to do is make electronic schematics of the microphone swith and the rotor controller. Currently these are hand drawn on paper. Once I make electronic versions, I can post them on github.

Did the Red cross again today. Did two Carraige Place Donor Center pickups. I though I had a Red Cross run tomorrow but I don't so thankfully I all of tomorrow off. Tuesday, the floor guy is coming to give me an estimate to refinish the hardwood floors and Tuesday Bob is coming to put the paneling up in the basement.
