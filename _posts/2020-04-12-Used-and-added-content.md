I used markup to add a blog post and added some content. I'm deleted the separate folder for the Rainbow LED cube. I'm going to put all the LED cubes under the same folder. I added another project called the Automatic Plant Watering Machine. Although I never actually built this machine, I wrote all the specifications for it as part of an online Internet of Things class I took from U of C Irwine. I was going to work on formatting the content that is already on the site but right now I think it is more important to get content and work on formatting later.
