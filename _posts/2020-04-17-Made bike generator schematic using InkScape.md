Made a schematic of the bike generator using InkScape. Had to store the file file as a pdf and convert it to jpg. Also changed the project lis to seperate it into active and acrchived projects. Also changed the homepage to reduce redant information.

Did the Red cross again today. Did a City Hospital run. It was pretty easy. Had to ask around in order to find the labs. Tomorrow Bob is coming over to pull up the carpet in the master bedroom and what was the radio room.
